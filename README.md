The dataset provided here has been extracted from the NSE website. The Stock price data provided is from 1-Jan-2015 to 31-July-2018 for six stocks Eicher Motors, Hero, Bajaj Auto, TVS Motors, Infosys and TCS.

Objectives/ Results Expected

1.Create a new table named 'bajaj1' containing the date, close price, 20 Day MA and 50 Day MA. (This has to be done for all 6 stocks).

2. Create a master table containing the date and close price of all the six stocks. (Column header for the price is the name of the stock).

3.Use the table created in Part(1) to generate buy and sell signal. Store this in another table named 'bajaj2'. Perform this operation for all stocks.

4.Create a User defined function, that takes the date as input and returns the signal for that particular day (Buy/Sell/Hold) for the Bajaj stock. (Hint: The signal of sell and buy for that particular day is 
  
  generated by subtracting the previous day's flag value. Flag value is generated using short-term and long-term moving averages.).
